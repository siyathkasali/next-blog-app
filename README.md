# next-blog-app
We are creating a simple web application build with Next.js, React, HTML/SASS.

We are using API server: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com as a data source
where we show all the posts in a table with headers id, userId, title and initially we are showing 20 per page in table. on scroll we are hitting api with pages incremented.

When you click on a post/row in the created table, you go to a new page/view where you can see all information about that given post. and also we hit one more API to get user results with post related to ID of the user.

We have used proper UX guidelines like page accessability to visual impaired persons also as we as a developer has to take care of all basic UX principles guidelines we have use rem/em for css.
